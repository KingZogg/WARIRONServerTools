OC0 is the number of objects currently in the mission (vehicles, players, AI, crates, tents, bunny rabbits and so on...)
OC1 is the number of vehicles in the mission.
OC2 is the number of "mission created objects" (*).

Alongside to the well known FPS (frames per second), an very interesting value, CPS, is introduced here.
CPS is expressed by condition evalations per second and measured from an reference condition in fn_ASM.fsm.
You can realize this CPS value as the reciprocal of the current "minimal response delay" of local AI in the running mission.


- OC[0..2] three independent, customizable "counter" (.sqf based)  
- PL# Number of alive player units
- AIL Number of alive server local AI units
- AIR Number of alive AI units on connected machines (remote)
- FPS (on a server this means simulation cycles per second)
- FPSmin (the minimum FPS of the last 16 cycles, hist. graph only)
- CPS Condition-evaluation per Second (rel. to AI response delay, VM load)
- MEM Amount of allocated physical memory
- NTI Network Traffic Incoming [kByte/s]
- NTO Network Traffic Outgoing [kByte/s]
- DIR DIsk Read [kByte/s]
- Name of the currently played mission (missionName)
- Name of the instance profile (profileName)

How to use ASM:

Additional hint: to avoid @ASM listing in arma server browser, just install ASM.pbo in a3\addons folder.

Extract this file: https://github.com/fred41/ASM/blob/master/addon/ASM.zip to your Arma 3 root folder.

Add -mod=@ASM to your server (or HC) launch params.

Run ArmaServerMonitor.exe from what directory you want, to monitor all your server (or HC) instances locally.

Additional, it is possible to connect to Arma Server Monitor from remote via TCP.
To watch your server from a remote device, you need an ASM instance on that device too and to configure it per start params as client.
Default start params for ArmaServerMonitor.exe are: -server -n1 -h127.0.0.1 -p24000
This means, ASM starts as monitoring server and listens at TCP port 24000, max. allowed remote clients = 1.

Example for client configuration: ArmaServerMonitor.exe -client -h201.178.1.102 -p24000

ASM starts as client and tries periodical to connect/read to/from your ASM server at 201.178.1.102:24000.
If your server is firewall protected, you have to open the selected TCP port on server.

You can activate the optional log feature, by adding -lfilenameprefix to your ASM start line.
By adding a -tinterval you can select the log interval in seconds (default 1). Values are ordered like this:

TimeStamp|FPS|CPS|PL#|AIL|AIR|OC0|OC1|OC2

To support monitors of different width, there is a -wxxx command line parameter, to set the width of the history graph in pixels/seconds.
This value should be set to a multiple of 60, or better of 300. Default is 900 pixels (-w900).
